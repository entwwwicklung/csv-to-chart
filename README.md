# csv-to-chart

Small electron app combined with some python script used to calculate and dispay data in bar charts.
Electron handles UI, user needsa to drag and drop .csv file on the main window and elecron will call python script which will do the math and return data to the electron which will display that data in bar charts.
App is full of bugs since it was used only for internal purposes.
